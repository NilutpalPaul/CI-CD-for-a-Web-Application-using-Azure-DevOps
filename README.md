# CI-CD-for-a-Web-Application-using-Azure-DevOps

This project involves setting up a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a web application using Azure DevOps. The project's main goal is to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application to Azure Web App Services.

We are creating a simple web application using Node.js with a basic frontend and backend.

# Azure DevOps Configuration:

1. Set up an Azure DevOps organization and project.
2. Create a Git repository to host the source code.
3. Define an Azure Pipelines CI/CD configuration in the azure-pipelines.yml file.

# Output:
The output of this project would be an automated CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys the web application to Azure Web App Services whenever changes are pushed to the Git repository. The pipeline ensures that the application is continuously integrated and delivered to Azure, making the development process more efficient and reducing the likelihood of errors in production.
